# Wardrobe

* A simple mod to swap your equipped armor and weapons with those on an armor stand.

## Installation

### Manual

  * Un-zip `TrapMeNot.dll` to your `/Valheim/BepInEx/plugins/` folder.

### Thunderstore (manual)

  * Go to Settings > Import local mod > Select `TrapMeNot_v1.2.0.zip`.
  * Click "OK/Import local mod" on the pop-up for information.

## Instructions

  * Target an Item Stand and use the keyboard short cut (default E + LeftAlt) to swap your equipped armor and weapons with what is on the Armor Stand.
  * You must **always** use E + a Modifier Key.  Not using E will cause the mod to stop working until you rebind it to E + a Modifier
  * The Armor Swap will fail if you attempt to use a Mannequin (ArmorStand_Male or ArmorStand_Female).  This is intentional as the Mannequin does not play well.
