# AsgardianAudioAdjuster

Your Fortress, Finally Fortified From Annoying Frequencies!

You've built a home worthy of a Jarl, but true peace is fleeting. Your magical shield hums an unending, 
monotonous melody. Your oven door screeches its protest with every use. And just outside, the winged woes 
of the Plains await with their maddening drone.

With the Asgardian Audio Adjuster, you are the master of your mead hall's melody. Pick and choose which 
pesky sounds to permanently put on pause. Savor the silence. You've earned it.
